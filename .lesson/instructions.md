Ask a customer to enter four things in this order: full name, 7 digit student ID, type of cookie (chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, or snickerdoodle) and the size cookie (6 inch, 8 inch, or 12 inch).
Use string variables for name and cookie type.
Use integers for ID and size.
Calculate the area of the cookie. 
Display the student's name, student ID, the type of cookies,  the cookie size, and the area of the cookie.
Show the area with precision to two decimal places.
Use the string library,  cmath library, and the iomanip library.

Use constants and data types appropriately

Use good programming style

HELPFUL HINTS:

Ï€ is the Greek letter pi. Declare a named constant PI which equals 3.14159
The user is inputting a diameter. You need to use the radius for the equation. Divide the diameter by 2 to find the radius.
Use the pow function to find the radius squared. I know it might be easier to skip it, but I want you to practice utilizing cmath functions.
Use typecasting if needed
See the General Help module for a review of typecasting
Use cin.get() if needed (and I predict you will need it)...check this out for different explanation
